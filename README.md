Playnine is a game developed using React JS.
Select the numbers from the box that equals the number of stars visible.
Complete the game so that no more numbers are available.
You have 5 attempts to refresh the stars if you cannot add the numbers to form the number of stars.
If the website does not open in your browser, try using plunkr editor online. It definitely works.
